## About ADO .NET technology
ADO.NET is a data access technology from the Microsoft .NET Framework that provides communication between relational and non-relational systems through a common set of components. ADO.NET is a set of computer software components that programmers can use to access data and data services from a database.

In particular, the examples of this repository represent cases of working with MS-SQL databases.
